** reFUND Scan
reFUNDScan is a tool used for tracking blockchain activity on Cosmos-SDK based chains, and sends those notifications 
to Telegram or Discord, or both! 

reFUNDScan is *extermely* configurable.

Want to track a specifc wallets' every action? You can do that!
Want to track all chain activity above a certain currency amount? Sure!
Want to block all transactions of a certain type, or that contain a certain address/keyword? Easy Peasy!
Want to send all chain activity to multiple channels, on multiple clients? You got it!
Want to name certain wallets for easier recognition? No issue!

The config.toml file generated by reFUNDScan is self documenting, and should be easy to understand. Here, you can
set many different parameters for enabling and disabling different types of messages, like delegations, transfers, etc.

** Build and Run
reFUNDScan is open-source and can be easily run by anybody, the main channel is hosted at @reFUNDScan for the [[https://unification.com/][Unification]] Chain

To build the bot yourself simply clone the repo:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/refundvalidator/reFUNDScan
#+end_src
Then run:
#+begin_src bash
cd reFUNDScan/src
#+end_src
Here, we can initialize our config file:
#+begin_src bash
go run . --init --config /folder/to/generate/config/
#+end_src
You'll need to set your Telegram/Discord Chat-IDs and APIs here, as well as the
Chains' name as it appears in the [[https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry][Cosmos Chain Registry]]. 

After filling out the custom information, you can run it with:
#+begin_src bash
go run . --config /folder/containing/config/
#+end_src
Or you can compile the binary yourself
#+begin_src bash
go build -o refundscan .
./refundscan --config ~/.refundscan
#+end_src
Pre-compiled binaries can be found in the releases section of this repo

If using one of the binary releases, you can generate a config file with:
#+begin_src bash
./refundscan --init --config ~/folder/to/generate/config/
#+end_src

NOTE: reFUND scan is a Work In Progress, so things may not work as expected for some given chains. The 
primary testing ground for this bot is on the Unificaton Chain.
** Configuration
reFUNDScan has the ability to pull chain information, and RPC and REST URLs, from the [[https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/tree/master][Cosmos Chain Registry]]  
just by being given a ~[chain]~ name. You'll want to ensure the name in this field is as it shows within the Registry

You can alternatively define many of these parameters yourself, in the config.toml file.

In this file, you can also define which messages to send/ignore, as well as set custom naming for the hyperlinks
the bot sends for a given address, by defining a new ~wallet~ field, with a couple examples predefined in the 
config file itself. 

You also have the ability to switch which explorer the bot uses for its hyperlinks, the default
being [[https://ping.pub][ping.pub]], but other preset options such as [[https://atomscan.com][atomscan]], [[https://mintscan.io][mintscan]], and [[https://bigdipper.live][bigdipper]]. If these do not suit your needs,
you can append custom values as well.
